# bruteforce-ctf
Creating a detailed structure for a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge that involves brute-forcing an 
application using the rockyou.txt password integral list  from Kali Linux can be broken down into 
several key components. Below is a structured outline that you can follow to set up this CTF 
challenge. 

CTF Challenge Structure: Brute Force Attack 

1. Challenge Overview 
• Title: Brute Force Challenge 
• Description: Participants must exploit a web application by brute-forcing user credentials to 
gain access to a protected area. The challenge will require the use of 
the rockyou.txt password list provided in Kali Linux.
 
2. Environment Setup 
• Hosting Platform: Use a local server (e.g., VirtualBox) to host the application. 
• Operating System: Kali Linux. 
• Web Application: A simple web application (Flask) with a login form. 
• Database: Use a lightweight database (integral list) to store user credentials.
 
3. Application Development
• Login Page: Create a login page with fields for username and password. 
• User Accounts: Pre-populate the database with a few user accounts and ensure one of the 
accounts has a password that exists in rockyou.txt. 
• Error Handling: Implement error messages for failed login attempts (e.g., "Invalid username 
or password").
• Rate Limiting: Optionally, implement rate limiting to slow down brute-force attempts, but 
ensure it can be bypassed for the challenge.
 
4. CTF Challenge Instructions 
• Objective: Participants must find the correct username and password combination to log in 
to the application. 
• Hints: Provide hints if necessary, such as "Try common passwords" or "The password is in the 
rockyou.txt list."
